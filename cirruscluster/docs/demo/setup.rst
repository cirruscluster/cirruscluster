You must install NX client on any computer from which you wish to work.  Also
because Cirrus Cluster launches computer resource on the public Amazon Web
Services cloud, youâ€™ll need to create an AWS account.

.. note:: You'll need to provide a credit card and phone number to create an AWS account.

Install NX Client
-----------------

The `NX client <http://www.nomachine.com>`_ allows you to use another computer
remotely as if it were your local machine.  It provides a fast full-screen GUI
session even across poor connections.  Please install the NX client for your OS:

 - `Linux <http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-linux.php>`_
 - `Mac OSX 10.3-10.6 <http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=3834>`_
 - `Mac OSX 10.7 <http://www.nomachine.com/preview/download-package.php?Prod_Id=15>`_
 - `Windows <http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=3835>`_

Create AWS Account
------------------

#. Go to http://aws.amazon.com
#. Click the **Sign Up** button
#. Follow the on-screen instructions


.. note::   
   If you are a student or researcher, you can `request a grant <http://aws.amazon.com/grants/>`_ for free AWS credits.  When your grant credit is exhausted, your credit card will be charged once again.    
   
.. warning::
   You are responsible for any charges you accrue for use of AWS resources.  When you complete a work session, always login to your `AWS management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/>`_ and check that your workstation instances are stopped and your cluster instances terminated to avoid accidently wasting resources.
