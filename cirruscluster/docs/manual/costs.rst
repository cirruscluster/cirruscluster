The Cirrus Cluster software is opensource and free to use.  However, you pay amazon for whatever resources you use.



:workstation:  The workstation costs $0.14/hr when running (or about $1 for typical workday). The workstation can be turned on and off as needed (and the data persists). The workstation storage costs < $1 per month.  When you are done using a workstation and no longer want to pay to keep the data, you can destroy it.



:cluster:  You can start a private cluster from your workstation in minutes when you need to compute, copy the output from the cluster FS back to your remote desktop, and destroy the cluster.  The cost of running a cluster depends depends on the number of nodes and the type of nodes.
