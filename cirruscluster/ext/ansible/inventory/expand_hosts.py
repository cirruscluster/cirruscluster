This module is for enhancing ansible's inventory parsing capability such
that it can deal with hostnames specified using a simple pattern in the
form of [beg:end], example: [1:5], [a:c], [D:G]. If beg is not specified,
it defaults to 0.

If beg is given and is left-zero-padded, e.g. '001', it is taken as a
formatting hint when the range is expanded. e.g. [001:010] is to be
expanded into 001, 002 ...009, 010.

Note that when beg is specified with left zero padding, then the length of
end must be the same as that of beg, else a exception is raised.

    The '[' and ']' characters are used to maintain the pseudo-code
    appearance. They are replaced in this function with '|' to ease
    string splitting.
